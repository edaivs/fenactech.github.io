<p><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold"> The Caribbean</span> is a magical place of palm trees, white sand beaches, turquoise waters and sunshine, all blessed with a climate that consistently offers a much-needed break for those stuck in the cold weather doldrums of the north.
If you haven't been, you should, and if you've been here more than once, you will come again, as these islands, these beach-ringed, jungle-covered rocks are home to thousands of historical surprises and activities galore.
So come wiggle you toes in the sand, and eat and sleep under the stars in the Caribbean. You won't be disappointed.</p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-weight: bold"> Caribbean Islands </span> are one of the most scenic destinations in the world, the Caribbean islands are a must-visit for any nature lover, romantic, or adventure seeker.

However, it's difficult to decide which island to visit, considering the beauty and appeal of each. We crunched the numbers and came up with a list of the 25 best countries, republics, and territories in the Western Hemisphere archipelago.

We evaluated the islands based on their flying time from New York City, the average hotel room cost, the number of attractions, and the Beach Density Index — a score that rewards an island for having a relatively large amount of potential beachfront for its size.</p>

The two main island groups lie on the outer edge of the Caribbean Plate and many of the land masses were formed as a result of the crust of the Caribbean Plate riding above the North American Plate.

<p>The Greater Antilles is a grouping of the larger islands in the Caribbean Sea; Cuba, Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica, and the Cayman Islands.Temperatures have dropped below freezing in North America, which means that it's time to think about heading south for a warm weather vacation.We recently ranked the Best Caribbean Islands, but it can still be difficult to determine which island is best for you.

 A Group of islands in North America,The Lesser Antilles is the name given to a group of islands in the Caribbean Sea. Most form a long, partly volcanic island arc between the Greater Antilles to the north-west and the continent of South America.

<p>The Lesser Antilles are situated at the eastern and southern edge of the Caribbean Sea and are made up of a line of fragmented land masses from the Virgin Islands in the north to Trinidad in the south, plus the Leeward Antilles (previously known as the Netherlands Antilles) which lie just north of Venezuela. 

The majority of these islands are volcanic and there are a few are flat coral structures (notably Barbados and the "Dutch ABC" islands). </p>

<p> Most of the Leeward islands are volcanic with a few that are flat coral structures.The Caribbean Leeward Islands are named due to the prevailing winds blowing north and they consist of Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Saint Martin, the British and United States Virgin Islands, Montserrat, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saba and Saint Barts.These islands are in the "Lee" of the wind, in other words the prevailing trade winds are blowing towards them.</p>

The Windward Islands are the southern, generally larger islands of the Lesser Antilles, within the West Indies. They lie south of the Leeward Islands, between latitudes 12° and 16° N and longitudes 60° and 62° W in one definition.If you're planning a tropical getaway, the Caribbean islands are a gold mine of beauty, seclusion, and adventure.Even though all the Caribbean islands are beautiful, some are better than others. So we decided to rank them.We figured that the best islands would have a low cost, be easy to get to, and have beautiful beaches and lots of activities. In most instances, we defined a Caribbean island as a single country, republic, or territory in the Caribbean.

<p>The Windward islands are situated at the foot of the Caribbean Sea and are a section of a line of fragmented land masses known as the Caribbean Lesser Antilles. The majority of the islands are volcanic and there are a few are flat coral structures (notably Barbados).The Caribbean Windward Islands are so named due to being on the windier and wetter side of the Lesser Antilles and consist of Martinique, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Saint Lucia, Barbados, Trinidad and Tobago and Grenada.Together all the Windward and Leeward Islands make up the Caribbean islands known as the Lesser Antilles.Today the Windward islands of the West Indies are one of the World's most popular tourist travel destinations with a huge demand within the Caribbean cruise industry. The region enjoys high temperatures all year around and attracts large numbers of people seeking a vacation in an idyllic tropical Caribbean island paradise. </p>

<p>To rank these islands, we factored in each island's average hotel room cost, according to Hotels.com; the distance from New York City; the number of attractions listed on TripAdvisor; and the amount of coastline per square kilometer, which we called the beach density score.</p>
