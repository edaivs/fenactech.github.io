<h3> Cuba </h3>
<p><img class="align-left" src="images/Cuba.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Cuba">
<img class="align-left" src="images/Cubaflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Cuba Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">The island of Cuba is part of the Greater Antilles group and its the largest single land mass in the Caribbean. The Republic of Cuba lies just 90 miles south of the tip of Florida and its neighbours include Jamaica and the Cayman Islands to the south and the Republic of Haiti to the east. To the north east lie the Bahamas.
<p>The main island of Cuba is 780 miles in length and 119 miles across at its widest point. The terrain is predominately flat or rolling plains. The Sierra Maestra mountain range is located in the southeast (which then dips under the sea and pops up again 200 miles to the south to form the Cayman Islands). The highest mountain is Pico Turquino at just under 6,500 feet. As well as the main island, the Republic of Cuba consists of more than 4,000 smaller islands and cays.
<p>Before the revolution in 1959, Cuba was a popular tourist destination for US citizens. The American mafia had considerable interests in both tourism and casinos in Cuba and together with large US companies, the United States had a great deal of influence, supported by Batista the ruling military dictator. Since the revolution, there has been a US trade and economic embargo. This has resulted in much of Cuba seemingly being left in a time warp. 

Investment in tourism only re-started in the 1990's after the Republic of Cuba lost financial support from the disbanded Soviet Union. US citizens (with relatives in Cuba) have only been allowed to visit the island since 2009. Today, many of the tourists come from Canada and Europe and Cuba has found a new economic partner in China.
Part of Havana is a UNESCO World Heritage Site along with Willemstad (in Curacao); historic Bridgetown (in Barbados) and Old San Juan (in Puerto Rico).

<p>The Jose Marti International Airport (Havana) is the main entry point for tourists with regular flights from Europe, Canada and Mexico. All tourists require an entry Visa which can be purchased in advance and is usually valid for 30 days. Furthermore, there is a departure tax of CUC 25 which bizarrely has to be paid in cash at the airport (there is no departure tax if leaving by sea). 

The local currency is the "Convertible Pesos" (CUC). US dollars are not accepted anywhere in Cuba and if you exchange USD for the local currency there is a further 10% exchange penalty (fine!) on top of the exchange rate which other currencies are not subject to. Canadian Dollars, Sterling and Euros are widely accepted for currency exchange. Essentially, Cuba welcomes tourists from most nations except the United States!</p>

<h3>Cayman Islands </h3>
<p><img class="align-right" src="images/Cayman%20Islands.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Cayman Islands">
<img class="align-right" src="images/Cayman%20Islandsflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Cayman Islands Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">The Caymans are located in the western Caribbean sea within the Greater Antilles archipelago, 480 miles south of Miami, Florida. The Caymans lie just over 200 miles due south of Cuba and around 300 miles west of the popular tourist island of Jamaica.
The Caymans are made up of three small land masses: Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman.
<p>The Caymans are all low lying coral and limestone structures which were formed on the peaks of a submerged mountain range which is an extension of the Sierra Maestra range in the Republic of Cuba. The islands sit atop the underwater Cayman Ridge which is flanked 4 miles to the south by the 20,000 foot deep Cayman Trough. With the highest point being just 140 feet above sea level, the Cayman Islands are often flooded and suffer roughly every 2 or 3 years from hurricane damage.
<p>The Caymans are made up of three islands, Grand Cayman, Cayman Brac and Little Cayman. Grand Cayman is the largest at 76 square miles, followed by Cayman Brac at 38 square miles and Little Cayman at 28 square miles. The two smaller land masses lie 75 miles northeast of the main island and are serviced by local air connections. George Town on Grand Cayman is the capital.The Cayman Islands are a British overseas territory which has a Governor appointed by the monarch on the advice of the UK government. Islanders have the highest standard of living in the Caribbean thanks to an economy which relies mainly on tourism and offshore financial services. 

Visitors to the Cayman Islands arrive by air at the Owen Roberts International Airport (Grand Cayman) and there are a surprising number of direct flights from North American cities as well as Canada, Kingston in Jamaica and Havana in Cuba. 

Cruise ships stop at the capital George Town on Grand Cayman. There are no berths for cruise liners, so all ships anchor off and tender passenger ashore.

<h3>Dominican Republic</h3>
<p><img class="align-left" src="images/Dominican%20Republic.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Dominican Republic">
<img class="align-left" src="images/Dominican%20Republicflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Dominican Republic Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">The Dominican Republic shares two thirds of the island of Hispaniola with the other third belonging to Haiti. The island of Hispaniola is one of only two in the Caribbean which share nations (Sint Maarten and St Martin being the other). 

The Dominican Republic is located in the Greater Antilles archipelago and is the second largest Caribbean island nation after the Republic of Cuba. The Dominican Republic lies south east of the tip of Florida and just west of Puerto Rico.
<p>The Dominican Republic was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1492 on his first of four voyages to the Americas. The capital Santo Domingo was the site of the very first European settlement in the Caribbean constructed from 1496 onwards. Columbus named the island "La Espanola" and claimed it for Spain. Columbus was actually buried in Santo Domingo when he died in 1506.
<p>After 300 years of mostly Spanish rule, the Dominican Republic gained it's independence in 1821. The following century was no less turbulent with a civil war, Spanish rule again for a while and the US occupation between 1916 and 1924. A final civil war took place in 1965 followed by authoritarian rule and since 1978 the island nation has slowly been moving towards stability and democratic rule.
<p>The economy today is driven by mining, agriculture and tourism and the Dominican Republic is now the Caribbean's largest tourist destination. A fast growing country and the second largest economy in the Caribbean after Trinidad and Tobago. </p>

<h3>Jamaica </h3>
<p><img class="align-right" src="images/Jamaica.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Jamaica">
<img class="align-right" src="images/Jamaicaflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Jamaica Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">Jamaica is located just west of the island of Hispaniola (Republic of Haiti and the Dominican Republic) and ninety miles south of the Republic of Cuba within the Greater Antilles archipelago. Jamaica is a mountainous island and the third largest in the Caribbean, 145 miles long and 50 miles wide.
<p>Jamaica is an English speaking independent territory and still remains part of the Commonwealth with the British Monarch as Head of State. The "Commonwealth of Jamaica" gained full independence in 1962 after leaving the Federation of the West Indies.
The population is around 2.8 million, made up of a rich mix of East Indians, Whites, Chinese and Arabs. Mixed race Jamaicans are the second largest racial group after East Indians. Christianity is the main religion within a parliamentary democracy and a constitutional monarchy.
<p>Around 1.3 million tourists visit Jamaica every year making tourism one of the most important sectors of the economy along with agriculture, mining and manufacturing. One of the main tourist areas are located in and around Montego Bay in the north west of the island. 

Montego Bay is the second largest city in Jamaica, after Kingston, and it is served by the Sir Donald Sangster International Airport, which is the busiest commercial airport. Montego Bay also has a free port with a cruise ship terminal. Cruise ships visiting Jamaica will stop here, not at Kingston. It's not one the most popular cruise ports in the the Caribbean, but an increasing number of ships are visiting Montego Bay.

<h3>Puerto Rico </h3>
<p><img class="align-left" src="images/Puerto%20Rico.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Puerto Rico">
<img class="align-left" src="images/Puerto%20Ricoflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Puerto Rico Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">Puerto Rico and it's smaller islands of Vieques, Culebra and Mona, lie southeast of the tip of Florida and the Bahamas. It is the smallest by size of the four big islands that make up the Greater Antilles (Cuba, Dominican Republic/Haiti, Jamaica and Puerto Rico); all are located in the western Caribbean Sea. (See our Greater Antilles Map). 

Puerto Rico lies on the eastern edge of the Greater Antilles and borders the top edge of the Caribbean Lesser Antilles. To the east lies the Virgin Islands within the Leeward Island group and the closest neighbour is Saint Thomas in the USVI group.

San Juan in Puerto Rico is a major embarkation port for cruise lines operating in the Caribbean. Many visitors will simply transfer from one of the local airports to the cruise ship port and never actually see any of the island. Driving from the airport through the modern part of San Juan, you will notice little difference to any metropolitan city in the USA. If you have a few hours to spare, old San Juan is a short taxi ride from the port and it's a fascinating old town when explored on foot (although there are a few no go areas to avoid).</p>

<h3>St. Martin </h3>

<p><img class="align-right" src="images/St.%20Martinflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt=" St.Martin Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">an island of two nations. The island is divided in two halves; the northern half belongs to the French and the southern half belongs to the Dutch and forms part of the Netherlands Antilles.

The island was originally named "Isla de San Martin" by Christopher Columbus when he landed here in 1493 and claimed the island for Spain. In 1648 the island was divided (as it is now) and during the following 160 years the whole island was occupied by the French, Dutch and English (at least twice each!) until in 1816 the French and Dutch areas resumed under the original 'Treaty of Concordia' agreement made in 1648.

The Dutch St Maarten (also known as "Sint Maarten" or "Eilandgebied Sint Maarten") lies to the south with it's capital of Philipsburg and a population of around 50,000. The word Eilandgebied means 'island area' in Dutch and it was part of the Netherlands Antilles (dissolution in 2010) and now Sint Maarten is a separate country or municipality within the Kingdom of the Netherlands together with it's neighbour Saba,  and the "ABC" islands further south of Aruba, Bonaire and Curacao. 

The area occupied by the Dutch is around 13 square miles. Philipsburg is a popular stopover with many cruise lines operating in the Caribbean and tourism forms the backbone of the island's economy together with a flourishing real estate market in condominiums and vacation homes. English is spoken on the Dutch side of the island and the official currency is the Netherlands Antilles Florin, but travellers will have no problem using US dollars.

The French St Martin (also known as "St-Martin" or "Collectivite de Saint-Martin") lies to the north with it's capital of Marigot, occupying around 20 square miles of the total island area and with a population of around 35,000. Until 2007 the French section of the island was part of Guadeloupe as a "commune" or overseas region of France and bizarrely part of the European Union. Since 2007 it is a separate overseas collectivity (COM) of France together with neighbouring St Barthelemy.

Tourism is the main economic activity and the official currency is the euro; however, as with Sint Maarten and most of the Caribbean region the US dollar is widely accepted. The native language is French and St Martin is less populated and slightly larger than it's Dutch neighbour.

<h3>US Virgin Islands</h3>

<p style="margin-right: 90px">
The USVI consist of three large isles of which the main one is Saint Thomas with it's capital Charlotte Amalie; a busy working port and one of the most popular cruise stopovers in the Caribbean. 

Charlotte Amalie was named after a Danish Queen and the town has the best shopping opportunities in the USVI on the busy main street which full of quaint stores, together with the colourful harbour front lined with old Danish buildings. The other two large isles are Saint Croix and Saint John.

There are seven main isles within the whole VI group which are divided in ownership between the United States (St Thomas, St Croix and St John) and the British (Tortola, Virgin Gorda, Jost Van Dyke and Anegada). The US and British Virgins lie just a few miles apart and around 90 miles east of Puerto Rico within a larger group known as the Caribbean Leewards. The USVI covers an area of some 134 square miles with a population of around 110,000.

<p><img class="align-right" src="images/British%20Virgin%20Islandsflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="British Virgin Islands Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">The British Virgin Islands are a group of over 60 idyllic and pristine isles in the Leeward chain with white sandy beaches, sheltered coves, blue waters and a laid back culture. The capital of the British Virgin Islands group is Road Town on the largest island of Tortola.

<p>The British Virgin Islands are one of the most popular sailing destinations in the World attracting thousands of boats where sailors can explore the secrets of the sixty island chain and still feel like there is enough space for everyone. Gems such as Gorda, Norman (the inspiration for "Treasure Island"), Sandy Spit, Great Tobago, Little Camanoe, Dead Chest Island (where the pirate Blackbeard marooned some of his crew) and Jost Van Dyke are just waiting to be explored.
<p>The British Virgin Islands have a total population of just 28,000, of which 80% live on Tortola with Gorda being the second largest. Only a small number of the British Virgin Islands are actually inhabited and the isles are known as "the land that time forgot". The first set of traffic lights were introduced in 2001 with instructions from the local government on how to use them. Jost Van Dyke only had mains electricity for the first time in 1991. 

<p>Some of the smaller isles are privately owned or have luxury resorts and include Necker (owned by Sir Richard Branson), Peter and Guana.
Locals are known as British Virgin Island landers and are very friendly and welcoming. The Editor has travelled extensively throughout the Caribbean and his personal favourite destination still remains the British Virgin Islands, especially Gorda with delightful scenery to explore including The Baths and Savannah Bay.</p>

<h3>Barbados</h3>
<p><img class="align-left" src="images/Barbados.jpg" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Barbados">
<p><img class="align-left" src="images/Barbadosflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Barbados Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">The island lies almost a hundred miles east of the main chain of Caribbean windward islands and some 1,600 miles southeast of Miami. It's a coral island and relatively flat compared to most of the neighbouring windward islands which are volcanic. The island is 21 miles long by 14 miles wide (166 square miles) and boasts 70 miles of white sandy beaches.

Barbados is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the Caribbean region with over a million annual visitors; half of the tourists are cruise ship passengers arriving at the harbour in Bridgetown (the island's historic capital). The warm tropical climate attracts most visitors to the island in the winter months from December through to May when the average daily high temperature is around 28 degrees Centigrade (83 degrees Fahrenheit). The winter is cooler and dryer; July is usually the wettest month. June to October is the hurricane season; particularly September and October which are also the most humid months. Not surprisingly, Christmas and Easter is the peak tourist season.
The island is known as "Little England" due to it's long 341 years of British colonial rule. The British landed in February 1625 at Holetown on the west coast and remained until independence in November 1966. Many Caribbean Islands changed hands several times; Barbados being somewhat more remote avoided the French, Danish and Spaniards who were busy fighting over the rest of the Caribbean.</p>

<p><img class="align-right" src="images/Dominicaflag.jpg" style ="width:300px; height:200px" alt="Dominica Flag">
<p style="margin-left: 10px">Dominica (not to be confused with the Dominican Republic) is the most southerly of the Caribbean Leeward island chain, located north of Martinique and south of Guadeloupe. The Commonwealth of Dominica ("Nature Isle of the Caribbean") is a fairly large island of around 290 square miles and a population of 72,000. The island is a democracy within the Commonwealth of Nations (republic) after being granted independence from the United Kingdom in 1978.

<p>Dominica was settled by the Caribs in the fourteenth century and they called the island "Waitikubuli". On Sunday November the 3rd 1493 Christopher Columbus named the island "Domenica" which means 'Sunday' in Italian. The Spanish never settle on the island and it remained in the hands of the Caribs until 1635 when the French claimed the island and French missionaries settled Dominica shortly after. The British invaded the island in 1761 and took control despite failed attempts by the French in 1795 and 1805 to regain control. Independence was granted in 1978.

<p>Dominica's capital is Roseau (population 15,000) on the eastern coast and other large settlement is Portsmouth (population 3,000). Roseau is the main cruise port for visiting ships. Portsmouth is the second largest town and lies at the mouth of the Indian River in the north of Dominica. Until 1760 it was the capital.

The official language spoken on the island is English (and French patois). The Eastern Caribbean Dollar is the official currency, although travellers will have no problem using US dollars.

Dominica is a mountainous volcanic island with lush rainforests, rivers and a wealth of natural beauty. It is said that the island has 365 rivers and numerous waterfalls. The tropical rainforest is well protected and the Morne Trois Pitons National Park is recognised as a World Heritage Site. The island doesn't have many typical pristine white sandy beaches associated with many other islands in the Caribbean; however, Dominica has "nature" as it's tourist attraction.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px">
Guadeloupe is part of the Caribbean Leeward island chain, located mid way between Antigua to the north and Dominica to the south. Another close neighbour is the island of Montserrat, just to the north west. Guadeloupe is an overseas department of France and a popular vacation destination for French visitors (83%) and those sailing the Caribbean.
<p>Guadeloupe was named "Santa Maria de Guadalupe de Extremadura" by Christopher Columbus when he landed on the island in 1493. Columbus was also the first European to discover the pineapple growing on the island of Guadeloupe. The island was first settled by the French in 1635 and changed hands several times with the British over the next century during conflicts for the lucrative sugar industry.
<p>Guadeloupe is actually not one, but five islands: Basse-Terre Island, Grande-Terre, La Desirade, Les Saintes and Marie-Galante (see map). The islands land area is quite large at over 600 square miles; with the main island of Basse-Terre having a volcanic mountainous interior. Grande Terre is much flatter with a large number of beaches.
Tourism and agriculture (sugar and bananas) are the main sources of income. The island capital is Basse-Terre and the population is over 450,000.</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10px">
This small emerald isle is located in the Caribbean Leeward island chain just 30 miles south west of Antigua, south of St Kitts and Nevis and north west of Guadeloupe. The island has a volcanic mountainous interior and is around 10 miles long and 7 miles wide.
It's nickname is "The Emerald Isle of the Caribbean" due both to it's similar appearance to coastal Ireland and the Irish decent of many of it's early European settlers.
<p>The emerald isle was sighted and named by Christopher Columbus on his second voyage to the West indies in 1493. He christened the island "Santa Maria de Montserrat" after the famous mountain monastery near Barcelona in Catalonia of the same name.
The island is a British overseas territory and was first occupied by the British in 1632 when Irish Catholics from nearby Saint Kitts colonised the island. In the 1800's one of the main exports was Lime and in the 1900's it was cotton. Today the economy relies quite heavily on tourism in common with many other destinations in the Caribbean.
<p>Natural disasters have taken their toll on this pretty island in recent times. In 1989 the emerald isle took a direct hit from Hurricane Hugo which damaged over 90 percent of the buildings and wiped out the tourist trade for several years.
The population was starting to get back on it's feet when the Soufriere Hills volcano erupted in 1995 and again in 1997 killing 19 people. The erupting volcano buried the island's capital of Plymouth, the dock and the W H Bramble airport. Montserrat's economy was almost completely destroyed and more than half of the population abandoned the isle to live elsewhere.</p>

the largest of the British Leeward Islands: 14 miles long and 11 miles wide and about 108 square miles in total. It's highest point is Boggy Peak (1,319 feet) in the south western corner of the island and the finest views can be seen from the famous lookout at Shirley Heights. The population of the island and it's dependency Barbuda is around 68,000 and the capital town is St. John's on the sheltered west coast.
<p>Antigua has an amazing 365 beaches - one for each day of the year! Obviously some of them are quite small and most of the beaches are located inside the protected waters of the island's Caribbean side such as Curtain Bluff, Rendezvous Bay, Windwood Beach and Mamora Bay (home of the world famous St James Club).
The tourist beaches of Dickenson Bay and Runaway Bay are located along the more developed north western coast which is the place to visit for the main resorts. The beaches and coves of the west and south western corner of the island are less developed than those around St John's. Worth exploring are Half Moon Bay, Darkwood Beach and Nonsuch bay.

<p style="margin-left: 10px">The island is part of the Caribbean Leeward Island chain and lies just southeast of Saba, west of Antigua and around 1,200 miles southeast of Florida. St Kitts and it's immediate neighbouring island of Nevis form an independent country called the "Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis". The two islands are separated by a 2 mile wide channel called the Narrows.

<p>St Kitts is also known as "Saint Christopher Island" and is about 18 miles long and 5 miles wide with a population of around 35,000. Formally St Kitts and Nevis were part of a larger British dependency which included Anguilla; the islands gained independence from Britain in 1983. These islands were among the first in the Caribbean to be settled by Europeans. Today the majority of the population are of African decent and the main language is still English with the highest literacy rate in the Caribbean.

<p>The island is part of the Caribbean Leeward Islands in the Lesser Antilles and is located west of Antigua and approximately 1,300 miles southeast of Miami, Florida. Nevis and it's larger neighbour of St Kitts are an independent country of the "Federation of Saint Kitts and Nevis". The islands are separated by a shallow two mile wide channel known as "The Narrows".

<p>Nevis is a conical island dominated by Nevis Peak which stands 985 metres (3,200 feet) above sea level. The volcano is considered dormant and last erupted in 1692. The interior of the island is mostly scrub following massive deforestation in the 17th and 18th centuries to make way for sugar plantations.Nevis population of just over 12,000 rely on tourism with some 40,000 annual visitors and the offshore financial services industry which is a rapidly growing economic sector.

<p style="margin-right: 90px">Martinique is the most northern of the Windward Islands, 15 miles south of Dominica and 23 miles north of St Lucia. The island is an overseas department of France; French speaking, part of the European Union and with the euro as the official currency. Creole patois is also spoken widely and English is not commonly spoken by locals. The main industry is tourism and island is popular with French travellers and it has a limited number of direct flights, other than from Paris.
<p>The island was discovered by Columbus in 1493 but he did not land on the island until his 4th voyage in 1502, when it was decided by the Spanish not to occupy the island. Martinique remained in the hands of the Carib people for another 133 years until the French arrived in 1635 and settled in the northwest region (now known as St Pierre). Apart from a few occupations by the British, the island has essentially remained in French hands for most of the last 4 centuries and in 1974 was granted the status of a French region.
<p>Martinique is a volcanic island and has a mountainous interior with lush rain forests and black sand beaches in the north. Mount Pelee which is the highest peak at 1,397 metres erupted in 1902 killing some 30,000 people and destroying the town of Saint Pierre (the volcano is now dormant). In the south there are beautiful beaches popular with tourists. The capital is Fort-de-France on the west coast of this fairly large island (50 miles long and 22 miles wide) with a total population of over 400,000.</p>

<p style="margin-right: 90px">Grenada is located in the southern Caribbean Windward island chain, just below St Vincent and to the north west of Trinidad and Tobago. The west indies island nation of Grenada includes several of the Grenadines islands including Carriacou (the largest), Ronde and Petit Martinique; along with a number of smaller islands which are mostly uninhabited.

<p><img class="align-left" src="images/Trinidad%20&%20Tobagoflag.png" width="300px" height="200px" alt="Trinidad and Tabago Flag">
<p style="margin-right: 90px">Trinidad is the larger of the two islands which together make up the country of Trinidad and Tobago. Trinidad is the southernmost of the islands and lies just seven miles north of Venezuela. Trinidad is also the most southerly of the Caribbean Windward island chain and one of the largest islands in the West Indies at more than 1,800 square miles. There are a further 21 smaller islands within the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.

<p>Tobago is the smaller island of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago (together with 21 smaller islands). Tobago lies just north of Trinidad and south east of Grenada in the southern Caribbean Windward island chain.

Tobago is just over one hundred square miles (26 miles long and 6 miles wide) with a population of just over 50,000. The capital is Scarborough where 17,000 of the island's inhabitants live. As part of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago it has been independent since 1976.

Tobago is a volcanic island with a line of small mountains running down the centre of the island with the highest point being Pigeon Peak near Speyside at 1,800 feet. The south east of the island is largely flat.

<p>Both Trinidad and Tobago were discovered by Christopher Columbus on his third voyage in 1498. Trinidad was named after the Holy Trinity and remained in Spanish hands until 1797 when the island surrendered to a British blockage of 18 warships. The two islands of Trinidad and Tobago were incorporated into a crown colony in 1888 which eventually obtained self governing status in 1958; which in turn led to independence in 1976 when Trinidad and Tobago became a republic.

Unlike most of the smaller Caribbean islands, Trinidad does not rely on tourism. There are very few resort areas. The island is quite industrialised with a diverse economy including the export of oil and natural gas with some large natural mineral reserves. Petroleum and Petrochemicals are the largest sources of income, followed by agriculture including the export of citrus and coca.</p>
